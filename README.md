# 50 Days 50 Python Projects

This repository is part of my long-term learning challenge to strengthen my Python programming skills through hands-on projects.  
Although the challenge started in 2023, academic workload slowed the pace. I have now resumed it with full focus.

✅ Completed: 20 / 50 Projects  
🎯 Goal: Strengthen logic, automation, games, file handling, NLP basics, and GUI development.
